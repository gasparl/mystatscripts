        <h1>Information and Consent</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Please read the following information carefully!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this two-part experiment, we use a response-time-based "lie detection" test to try to detect whether or not a participant recognizes certain "incriminating" information after having committed (or not having committed, depending on group assignment) a simulated online "crime". The first part
            (<i>Part
                1</i>; ca. 5
            minutes) is to be completed now, while the second part (<i>Part 2</i>; ca. 20 minutes) has to be completed tomorrow around the same time.<br>
            <u><i>Part 1:</i></u><br>
            Depending on random group assignment, you may be asked to log into an email account and "steal" certain credit card details. This is all part of the experiment and you will not be asked to commit any actual crimes. This part takes about 5
            minutes maximum.<br>
            <u><i>Part 2:</i></u><br>
            <b>You should start Part 2 approximately 24 hours following the completion of Part 1. To be precise: the time passed between Part 1 and Part 2 must be between 21 and 27 hours.</b>
            In this part, you will be tested using the lie detection test. We will of course in fact know whether you took part in the "crime", but, for the sake of the simulation, we ask you to <i>deny</i> having done it and imagine yourself in a
            situation where you would actually want to "beat" the lie detection test in order to seem innocent. After the lie detection task, there will be a very short questionnaire. This entire Part 2
            takes about 20 minutes.
            <br>
            <u>The aim of this study:</u> Firstly, we would like to see how well our lie detection test works in this situation. Secondly, different participants will perform slightly different tasks, and we will examine which type of task works best
            for lie detection. Detailed technical information will be provided at the end of the experiment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Importantly, because of technical reasons, you can only start this experiment one single time. If you click "I consent" now but you leave this website afterwards without completing this first part, you will not be able to later continue
            or restart this experiment with the same Prolific account.
