         In the following test, we will try to reveal whether or not you recognize certain details related to a crime committed yesterday. If you did not participate in the crime, you have nothing to fear. If you participated in the crime – which you
         are denying – you should try your best to avoid being detected.

         <b>This is the end of the experiment, thank you for participating!</b>
         <br>
         <br>Once again, rest assured that you did not commit any real crime, and the credit card details were all fictional. <b>However, please do remember that you must not share any of the details from our tasks with anyone within the next two
             months (unless with our explicit written permission)!</b>
         <br>
         <br> Short info about this test:
         <br> Our key assumption is that those who actually "stole" the credit card details, and hence recognized these among the other details, tend to (very shortly) hesitate when responding to these items, and therefore will have slower responses
         to these than to the other items. Based on this response time difference, we can distinguish participants who actually committed the simulated crime from those who did not. <br>
         Apart from assessing whether this really works (and hence might be applied in similar real situations), we also compare the results of different participants who performed slightly different tasks, to see which works best for lie detection.
         This concerns the addition of certain "filler" items in the task that had been found to further slow down responses to the critical details and thereby make distinguishing those who recognize the details even better (see e.g. <a
             href="https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3565" target="_blank">here</a>). In the
         current study, these fillers were presented in various proportions for each participant, and they consisted of various types of items (numbers, symbols, or meaningful words), and all these different conditions will be compared to each other.
